      "The rococo style began in the 1730s as a reaction against the more formal and geometric style louis xiv. the term rocaille was first used in print in 1825 to describe decoration which was \"out of style and old-fashioned\" since the mid-19th century, the term has been accepted by art historians.\n",
      "the rocaille style, or french rococo, appeared in paris during the reign of louis xv. it was used particularly in salons, a new style of room designed to impress and entertain guests. the furniture designers and craftsmen in the style included juste-aurele meissonier and nicolas pineau.\n",
      "the venetian rococo style is deeply anchored in popular culture. it is characterized by a light-filled weightlessness, festive cheerfulness and movement. the style reached its peak in southern germany and austria from the 1730s until the 1770s.\n",
      "françois de cuvilliés was one of the first to create a rococo building in germany. the pavilion of amalienburg in munich was inspired by the pavilions of the trianon and marly. a number of notable pilgrimage churches were constructed in the 1740s and 1750s.\n",
      "in great britain, rococo was called the \"french taste\" and had less influence on design and decorative arts than in continental europe. before entering the rococo, british furniture for a time followed the neoclassical palladian model under designer william kent. the furniture of thomas chippendale was the closest to the style.\n",
      "rocaille emerged in france between 1710 and 1750, mostly during the regency and reign of louis xv. the best known french furniture designer of the period was juste-aurèle meissonnier (1695–1750) his work is well known today because of the enormous number of engravings made of his work.\n",
      "the rocaille style flourished in rome, milan and venice. the most extravagant rocaille forms were found in the consoles. chinoiserie, or chests, first appeared under louis xiv.\n",
      "françois boucher (1703–1770) was the favorite painter of madame de pompadour. he painted the sensual toilette de venus (1746) which became one of the best known examples. other important painters of the style included françois lemoyne and françois lancret.\n",
      "the most elaborate examples of rococo sculpture were found in spain, austria and southern germany. the porcelain figure, or small group of figures, was popular for placing on mantelpieces and furniture.\n",
      "a rococo period existed in music history, although it is not as well known as the earlier baroque and later classical forms. in the second half of the 18th century, a reaction against the style occurred, primarily against its perceived overuse of ornamentation and decoration. the style was based on extravagance, elegance, refinement and decoration.\n",
      "after the death of louis xiv the fashion took a turn to a lighter, more frivolous style. the later period was known for their pastel colours, more revealing frocks. 'pannier' and 'mantua' became fashionable around 1718.\n",
      "accessories were also important to all women during this period. at any official ceremony ladies were required to cover their hands and arms with gloves if their clothes were sleeveless.\n",
